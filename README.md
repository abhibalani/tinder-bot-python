## Python Tinder Bot

This python script will save your time by auto swiping in your tinder account and will 
save the stats in a file.

**Important**: The script just does the auto swiping. You have to do the first login manually.

#### Setup:
* Download chromedriver, save it in the script folder or anywhere and update the path on line 35
* Install selenium in your venv with the command pip install selenium

#### Running the Bot
* Run the `tinder_bot.py` in debugging mode and pause the debugger once the page loads
* Manually login to your tinder account (You have to do this only the first time)
* Restart the script and the auto_swiping should work

Now, every time you run the script, your tinder will already be logged in.
